If you no longer wish to use your AdGuard Mail subscription, you may request a refund. Refund eligibility depends on where you purchased your subscription.

## Subscription purchased on the AdGuard Mail website

We have a 30-day money-back guarantee for 1-year subscriptions purchased from the AdGuard Mail website. Monthly subscriptions are non-refundable.

To request a refund for a 1-year subscription, please email us at [support@adguard-mail.com](mailto:support@adguard-mail.com).

Processing time depends on your payment method and usually takes up to 10 business days. Once the refund is processed, your subscription will be canceled, and your plan will switch to the free version.

## Subscription purchased via App Store and Google Play
