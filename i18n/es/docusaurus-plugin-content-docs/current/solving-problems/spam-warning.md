title: I received a spam warning

This can happen for two reasons: you’ve marked a forwarded email as spam, or someone has marked your reply as spam.

We don’t allow spam reports in our service and warn users when that happens. General advice on how to avoid these warnings: **do not mark emails received through your aliases as spam** and **be mindful of what you write in replies**.

## Why we don’t allow spam reports

Email services treat AdGuard Mail as the sender of all forwarded emails, including replies from aliases. If people mark too many messages from AdGuard Mail as spam, email services may block all emails from AdGuard Mail for everyone.

## How to avoid spam reports

### Be careful with your replies

You can’t fully control whether someone marks your replies as spam, but please do your best to reduce the risk of spam reports. Try to avoid replying to certain messages, make your replies look less like possible spam, or talk to your correspondent if you can.

If your correspondent marks emails from your aliases as spam 3 times, you won’t be able to reply to emails sent to you by your aliases. However, you can still use other AdGuard Mail features.

### Use other options to stop unwanted mail

If you think you’re getting spam, use the _Block this sender_ option in the email header.

Alternatively, you can disable the alias. Emails from this alias won’t be forwarded.

Marking 4 forwarded emails as spam will block all your aliases.
