To upgrade your plan and unlock access to [advanced AdGuard Mail features](/subscription/free_vs_full), you need to purchase a subscription.

## Where to buy an AdGuard Mail subscription

You can buy a subscription in two ways:

- [On the official website](https://adguard-mail.com/license.html)
- In-app via App Store (for iOS and macOS) or Google Play (for Android)

In both cases, the subscription is linked to the email address you use for your account in AdGuard Mail. For example, if you purchase a subscription through the App Store on your iPhone, you can also use it on a Windows computer. Make sure you log in with the same email address.

You can use your subscription on an unlimited number of devices.

## When is the subscription activated?

The subscription is activated immediately after purchase. However, if you don’t see any changes after purchasing the subscription, go to _Settings → Account_ and click _Refresh license status_.

## Changing the subscription plan

You can switch between a monthly and a 1-year subscription at any time.

For example, if you have a monthly subscription, you can purchase a 1-year subscription on the [AdGuard Mail website](https://adguard-mail.com/license.html). The new year will be added to your remaining subscription term. When your monthly subscription ends, you’ll be switched to annual billing.

The same applies when you switch from a 1-year subscription to a monthly plan.
