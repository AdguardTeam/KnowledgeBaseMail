The service is designed to help users protect their personal email addresses by offering features such as email aliases ([_Aliases_](#aliases)) and temporary email addresses ([_Temp Mail_](#temp-mail)), shielding their regular inboxes from spam, phishing attempts, and unwanted tracking.
​

## Aliases

An **email alias** is a forwarding address that allows users to receive emails without disclosing their primary email address. Emails sent to an alias are automatically forwarded to the user’s main inbox, providing a layer of privacy and organization.​ Aliases feature in AdGuard Mail lets you create multiple email aliases for different platforms and purposes.

### Benefits of using aliases

- **Enhanced privacy:** By using an alias, your real email address remains concealed from the sender, reducing exposure to [tracking](https://adguard.com/blog/id-bridging-tracking-privacy.html), spam and phishing attacks.​

- **Control over incoming emails:** If an alias begins to receive unwanted emails, it can be easily disabled, stopping further messages from reaching your main inbox.​

- **Organized email management:** Aliases can be created for specific purposes (e.g., shopping, newsletters, use of tools and services, work), which makes organizing and filtering incoming emails easier.​

### How aliases in AdGuard Mail work

1. Open the AdGuard Mail app or the web version.
2. Go to _Aliases_ and click _Create_.​
3. Assign a name and to the alias for easy identification.
4. Specify the recipient email address where forwarded emails should be sent​.
5. Click _Create_ to save the alias.

Done! Now you can use the created alias when signing up for services or sharing your email address.

## Aliases vs Temp Mail: When to use each one

When deciding whether to use an alias or a temporary email address, consider:

- The nature and duration of your interaction
- How important is the data you receive via email
- For how long do you want to keep the received emails

Using both features for different purposes lets you make the best of this functionality.
