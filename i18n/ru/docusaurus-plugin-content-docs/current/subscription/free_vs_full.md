AdGuard Mail is available in two versions: a free version with limited functionality and a full version with advanced features. Below is a comparison of these two versions.

| **Features**          | **Free version** | **Full version** |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| **Aliases**           | 10               | 1,000            |
| **Recipients**        | 1                | 50               |
| **Forwarded emails**  | 2,000/month      | Unlimited        |
| **Anonymous replies** | -                | 300/day          |
| **Alias domains**     | 1                | 3                |

## Benefits of advanced features

### Aliases

Multiple aliases give you more control over your email subscriptions. If you use a single alias for multiple services and want to stop emails from a particular service, disabling the alias may affect others.

### Recipients

The full version allows you to add 50 recipients. This means that you can manage email subscriptions for multiple inboxes under one account, including your personal, work, or family email addresses.

### Forwarded emails

The free version limits email forwarding to 2,000 messages per month. Once the limit is reached, forwarding stops until the 1st day of the next month. The full version removes this restriction and ensures that you never miss an important email.

:::note

The forwarding limit of 2,000 emails only applies to active aliases. Emails sent to disabled aliases are not forwarded, and they do not count toward the limit.

### Anonymous replies

The full version allows you to reply directly from your aliases. This is useful when communicating with services where youâ€™ve signed up using an alias.

### Alias domains

An alias domain is the part of an alias address that comes after the @ symbol.

With the free version of the app, you can use one alias domain. The full version unlocks access to more domains.

More domain options mean less risk of being rejected by services. If an alias is not accepted, you can use an alias with a different domain.
