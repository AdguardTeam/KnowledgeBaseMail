This article is about AdGuard Mail, a privacy-focused email management tool. To see how it works, get the [AdGuard Mail app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-mail).

AdGuard Mail is designed to protect user privacy, but to maintain a reliable and fair service, we have a few important rules that we urge every user to follow. Violating them can lead to restrictions or even a ban on your account.

## Don’t make several accounts on the same website using aliases

While aliases offer the ability to create unique email addresses quickly, **creating multiple accounts on a single service** using different aliases is against most platforms’ terms and can lead to your AdGuard Mail features being restricted. Always respect the terms of use of external websites.

## Don’t mark emails forwarded by aliases as spam

When you mark an email forwarded through an AdGuard Mail alias as spam in your email client, it often reports the forwarding server itself (AdGuard Mail) as the spam source. This can damage the reputation of AdGuard Mail’s servers and jeopardize service quality for all users.

Therefore, if you encounter spam and want to block a sender, please use *Block this sender* option in the email header.

If you do mark an AdGuard Mail alias as spam, we will send you a warning message. After 4 spam reports, we will permanently disable your aliases.

## Don’t send spam when replying to forwarded emails

Replying to emails received through an alias should be done responsibly. When replying, if your response contains spammy content, it could be flagged and traced back to AdGuard Mail. **Sending spam or abusive messages via the service is strictly prohibited**. After 3 violations, we will permanently disable replies for your account.
