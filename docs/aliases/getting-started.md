    :::note

    In the full version of AdGuard Mail, you can use *premium alias domains*, which allows you to choose different domain options when creating an alias. This minimizes the cases of getting rejected by online platforms.

    :::

1. Assign a name and description to the alias to make identification inside AdGuard Mail easier (optional).

1. Choose a recipient that should be linked to this alias (only in full version).

    :::note

    Ability to have multiple recipients is a feature of the AdGuard Mail’s full version.

    :::

1. Enter a tag to use [subaddressing](#subaddressing) (optional).

1. Click *Create*.

1. Done! Use the alias as a unique email address to share or sign up on online platforms.

This new alias will act as a will protect your personal data by forwarding messages to your selected inbox without exposing your real email address.

## What is a recipient?

In AdGuard Mail, a recipient refers to your actual email address that receives the forwarded messages from your aliases. You can add multiple recipients under your account. This allows you to manage different types of forwarded content — for example, separating work and personal messages.

## Subaddressing

Subaddressing is a feature that lets you “tag” an alias so that it’s easier to find it in your main inbox.

Here’s how it works: instead of creating `alias@adguardmail.com` for online shopping platforms, you can create aliases that look like `alias+shops@adguardmail.com` — that’ll allow you to easily find and filter all shopping-related emails forwarded from AdGuard Mail. For example, you can search for your alias+tag@adguardmail.com by using +tag@adguardmail.com. Some email clients also allow [creating filters for such tags](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?sjid=13237949311055776988-EU).

## Multiple aliases

You can use multiple aliases at once — 10 in the free version and 1,000 in the full version. This is useful when, for example, you need a special alias for newsletters, for a short-term project, for shopping, and so on.
