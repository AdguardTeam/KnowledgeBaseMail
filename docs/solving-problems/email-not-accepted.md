title: Email address is not accepted by a website

Occasionally, some websites may not accept email addresses with unknown or non-standard domains, including the ones used for aliases or temporary emails.

:::note

Domain is the part of an alias address that comes after the @ symbol.

## If an alias isn’t accepted

- The problem also might be in **subaddressing** — a special tag used to filter emails in the mailbox. An email with subaddressing looks like this: <alias+tag@adguardmail.com>, and some websites might not accept the domains with a **+**. If you are using an alias with subaddressing, try one without it.

If the problem persists, please contact our support team via *Report a bug* or at <support@adguard-mail.com>.

## If a temporary address is not accepted

Let our support team know via *Report a bug* or at <support@adguard-mail.com>. We will look into the issue and update the domain if necessary.
