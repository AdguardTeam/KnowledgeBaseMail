This article is about AdGuard Mail, a privacy-focused email management tool. To see how it works, get the [AdGuard Mail app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-mail).

To create a temporary email address, go to the *Temp mail* section in the side menu and click *Create*. A temporary address will be generated. There’s no time limit on this address; keep it as long as you like.

## Changing address

You can change your address by clicking the *dice* icon. The old one will be deleted along with its inbox. Note that you won’t be able to recover it.

## Number of inboxes

AdGuard Mail allows using only one temporary email address at a time. Creating a new one will replace the existing address.

## Inbox and email size

**Email size:** Temp mail can accept messages up to 2 MB in size. Since most emails are between 10 KB and 100 KB, this should cover regular use. If an email is too large for Temp mail, we’ll send a notification to the email associated with your account.

**Inbox capacity:** Your temporary inbox can hold up to 100 MB — it takes about 1,000 emails to reach this limit. Once this limit is reached, you won’t be able to receive new emails. We’ll notify you as you approach this limit so you can take action — either delete emails you don’t need or just create a new temporary address.

## Replying and forwarding

Temp mail is designed for receiving emails only. While you can’t reply to or forward emails directly from Temp mail, you can download them in EML format and send them using a regular email client.

## Attachments

Temp mail does not support attachments. If an incoming email contains attachments, AdGuard Mail will remove them, and you’ll receive a notification indicating what has been removed.

If you’re expecting emails with attachments, use an alias instead — aliases support attachments.

## Deleting address

If you no longer need your temporary email address, you can delete it by clicking the *dice* icon. The address will also be deleted if you delete your AdGuard account.

Keep in mind that **once deleted, the address and its inbox cannot be recovered**. Be sure to check your temporary inbox for important messages before you click the *dice* icon.
